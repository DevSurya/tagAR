Current Version 1.0
Changes Since Version 0.4

The version has jumped from Version 0.4 to Version 1.0 is because in this update we are releasing a new feature.
Please the wiki at https://github.com/mustafaneguib/tagAR/wiki for more information about the versioning being followed.

Firstly, we know that the login facility was a pain to use. Having to login again and again when ever you exited the application
you had to enter your email and password again. we know that it is a pain, because we ourselves didn't like that, but we have 
developed a feature which will make your login worries fade away. We are proud to introduce the much needed new "remember my login 
details" as we like to call it. In this feature the user will only have to login for the first time (we can not guess what your login
details are for the first time, though that may not entirely be impossible... :P ) and then if the login is successful we store those
login details encrypted in the internal memory of the mobile device and make it private so that no other unwelcome app can gain access to
the login details. The next time you will login the system will check if such details exist and will show your list of emails (yes, we are 
storing a list of emails so that you can login easily via different accounts if you have and not just one). All you have to is to touch one of
the emails being shown once, and you will be redirected to the login page with the login details already entered (see didn't i tell you how awesome and
easy it was going to be to login into tagAR now :D ).

Secondly, a minor change is that we have renamed the Exit option in Screen5.java to Exit(Logout) so that the users know that they will be
logging out when they select this option. 

Finally, in order to support this feature we have added some support code which connect with Screen3.java so that we can pass the required
data to Screen3.java. We have mentioned in the code which are new additions and changes.
