Current Version 2.0
Changes Since Version 1.0

New features have been introduced and some have been improved.
Firstly, we have improved the tagging feature. In the earlier versions the user had to actually
hold up the mobile device in the direction of the tag to be posted while typing the comment in 
order to get the tag in the intended direction. Now we are saving the value of the direction before hand when 
the tagIT button is clicked. More information regarding this has been added in the code (Screen6.java).

Secondly, we are now storing the accuracy of the tag in the database and showing it in the description of the tag, as after use of the app, we have found out
that the location provider does not give 100% accuracy due to a number of different factors which we will not discuss.
So the tag the user may post may not be accurate, so we are showing what the accuracy of the tag is.

Thirdly, the new feature being introduced in Version 2.0 is the ability to post pictures of the location being tagged. The user 
will have the option of taking pictures at the time the tagit button is pressed and the image will be uploaded to the server. When the 
tag will be retrieved from the server, so will the image be, and will be display as a small thumbnail in the tag's modal, and
upon touching the image a bigger version of the image will be shown in a new modal. We are keeping the images to be of 80% quality than the original
and the images size is 350 by 350 pixels. To enable the choice, we are using shared preferences to store the setting, and the setting can be changed
in the Settings option which can be found on the Menu Screen. This setting will be enabled by default.

Lastly, we have developed a new Menu Screen, with graphical icons instead of the boring list. These images have been made by
us and we have used ImageView to place them in.
