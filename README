Current Version of Project Code: 0.4

To all open source developers out there. We need your help in further developing and improving this application.
We have published this appplication on to Google Play and are awaiting for the application to be live. We will update this 
file with the information as soon as we get it.

This application has been tested on the following devices:

Samsung Galaxy Ace GT-S5830 running Android 2.2.1

We need your help in testing this app on the other Android powered devices as well and tell us if it works on them.
We also need your help in developing fixes if you find any, and to return them to us so that we can incorporate them into the project.
Mean while we will also be working on improving this app, by adding new features and fixing bugs if we find any.

This is version 0.3 of the application. We will be using the following versioning:
The major(before the period) is incremented when a new feature is introduced into the app. 
The minor(after the period) is incremented when a bug is fixed in the app.

This app contains two parts, a client part(Android code), and the server part (PHP code). The Android part is the code that we run as an apk file, 
while the server part has been hosted on our server.

A history of changes starting from Version 0.0 till Version 0.4

We have made some changes and fixed some bugs from version 0.0 and 0.1.

Changes Since Version 0.0 to Version 0.1

As expected some of the mobile devices, such as HTC Wildfire S did not show the textures built by OpenGL ES in Screen6.java activity.
I also tested the app on Galaxy S and that infact only showed white objects, but no textures. To fix this i decided to replace the OpenGL ES
graphics with Canvas graphics, and drawables. Now showing these graphics should not cause a problem as i am now using the standard techniques
and Canvas graphics are supported on all of the graphics as far as i know. Due to this the code base has significantly been reduced in size.
I have removed the package com.OpenGLModelObjectLoader all together as that package was responsible for drawing OpenGL ES models. In place of the package
i have included an inner public class CustomView which extends the View class in the com.Screens.Screen6.java class.
Now this new CustomView draws the graphics onto the screen. However, at the moment i am only assuming that this new technique will hopefully work on all of the
mobile devices, but i will not be certain until i test this app on all of the mobile devices. So at the moment there is no guarantee that this will work on all of
the mobile devices, but theoretically this should work on all of the mobile devices.

Another change that has been possible due to using of Canvas graphics is that i can now show text on top of the tags. This text 
is the part of the comment that the user enters when adding a tag.
		

Changes Since Version 0.1 to Version 0.2

In this version i have made some minor changes only.
Firstly, i have fixed the screen orientation for all of the screens (activities in the com.Screens package) to landscape. This
was to allow for easier data input.
Furthermore, i have made a small change in the logic for displaying the tags. In version 0.1 i was getting the tags whose difference 
between the direction value and the current value of the direction given by the accelerometer was between -10 and 10. I have increased
this window to -20 and 20. Now the tags will be displayed for a loner period of time.

Lastly, in the server code (being run on the web server) i have decreased the distanc radius to 5 km, that is tags which are within 5 km from
the retrieved geo-location data will be shown, rather than 10 km as before. The number of tags retrieved is still 10. 	

The code that will be hosted on github.com will always be of the latest version. For example at the moment the code that is online is of version 0.2.

Finally we are working on setting up and writing tutorials on the project in the wiki, so check out the wiki section regularly for latest content.


Changes Since Version 0.2 to Version 0.3

In this version i have made some major fixes to the tagging screen. 

Firstly, i have catered the  app to be run on different screen sizes (Our inital testing has given us positive results, but this 
testing has been done on Samsung Galaxy Ace GT-S5830 and also on the Android Emulator (of different screen sizes), but we still
need to test this on other mobile devices.

Secondly, we have tried to make the selecting of the tags more accurate, and have tested it on the above mentioned, but then 
we will not be sure until we test it on actual mobile devices.

Finally, we have catered a scenario where the app could be put in the background when the Home button is pressed, while the location 
data was being retrieved from the providers. To solve this we have decided to stop listening for updates as soon as we get the location
updates. This also allows us to save the battery and prevents the system to constantly ask for updates.    
	
Changes Since Version 0.3 to Version 0.4

Firstly, in Screen5.java the app was crashing if the gps and wireless providers are not enabled when the activity runs the 
onPause method before being redirected to the settings screen to turn on the gps and wireless providers.

Secondly, the tags are being shown about 50 units to the right of the last tag. This is to cater tags that overlap each other.
		 
Thirdly, i have made the touching (selecting) of tags more robust, where only those tags which are being shown on the screen will be selected. 
Before this fix even those tags (not being shown on the screen) were being selected and their data being shown in the modal which were close by to the tags being
shown on the screen. By introducing this fix now only the tags that are shown to the screen are being selected when touched.

Finally, i have added some more information in the About screen (Screen7.java) about the app.
