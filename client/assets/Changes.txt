Current Version 0.4
Changes Since Version 0.3

Firstly, in Screen5.java the app was crashing if the gps and wireless providers are not enabled when the activity runs the 
onPause method before being redirected to the settings screen to turn on the gps and wireless providers.

Secondly, the tags are being shown about 50 units to the right of the last tag. This is to cater tags that overlap each other.
		 
Thirdly, i have made the touching (selecting) of tags more robust, where only those tags which are being shown on the screen will be selected. 
Before this fix even those tags (not being shown on the screen) were being selected and their data being shown in the modal which were close by to the tags being
shown on the screen. By introducing this fix now only the tags that are shown to the screen are being selected when touched.

Finally, i have added some more information in the About screen (Screen7.java) about the app.
